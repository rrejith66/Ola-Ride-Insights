# 🚖 Ola Ride Insights – Business Analytics Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Ola Ride Insights is a data analytics project aimed at understanding ride patterns, customer satisfaction, driver performance, and revenue optimization. Using ride-level data (distance, duration, fare, ratings, etc.), this project provides actionable business insights that can improve operations, customer experience, and profitability.

## 📊 Key Findings  
- **Ride Demand:** Peak rides during morning/evening commutes and weekends; specific zones dominate demand.  
- **Fare Trends:** Fares rise with distance; certain routes and vehicle types generate higher revenue.  
- **Ride Patterns:** Longer rides cluster in specific zones; short rides dominate urban areas.  
- **Customer Ratings:** Majority rated 4–5; dissatisfaction linked to long waits at peak hours.  
- **Driver Ratings:** Higher in busy zones; low ratings mostly from delays and cancellations.

## 💡 Business Recommendations  
- **Fleet Deployment:** Increase drivers in peak hours and high-demand zones.  
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Apply surge pricing on busy routes.  
- **Customer Experience:** Reduce wait times and monitor driver performance.  
- **Driver Management:** Provide training and incentives for quality service.  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Allocate rides strategically using distance–duration patterns.
